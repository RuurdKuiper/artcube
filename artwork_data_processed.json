Renowned for its massive dome, innovative use of pendentives, and richly decorated interiors, it was the world's largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years. Following the Ottoman conquest in 1453, it was converted into a mosque, with minarets and other Islamic features added. In 1935, it became a museum under the Turkish Republic, and in 2020 it was reconverted into a mosque.

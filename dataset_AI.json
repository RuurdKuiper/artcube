      "description": "The Night Watch, formally titled 'Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq', is a monumental group portrait by Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn. Painted in 1642, it depicts a city militia moving out, led by Captain Frans Banning Cocq and his lieutenant, Willem van Ruytenburch. Renowned for its dramatic use of light and shadow (tenebrism) and dynamic composition, the painting transforms a traditional civic guard portrait into a vibrant narrative scene. Despite its popular name, the scene takes place in daylight; the darkened appearance is due to the varnish and aging of the painting.",

Characterized by their distinctive fluting, these stone tools were used primarily as spear points for hunting large game such as Bison antiquus. The first recognized Folsom point was discovered in 1908 at the Folsom site in New Mexico, embedded in the remains of an extinct bison, providing crucial evidence for the antiquity of human presence in the Americas. The points are notable for their advanced flintknapping techniques and are considered a hallmark of early North American lithic technology.",

The geoglyphs were produced by the Paracas and Nazca cultures over a millennium, with two major phases: the Paracas phase (c. 400–200 BCE) and the Nazca phase (c. 200 BCE–500 CE). Their purpose remains debated, with theories ranging from astronomical and calendrical functions to ritual pathways and water-related ceremonies.
